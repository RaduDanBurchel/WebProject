# WebProject
You will build a mentoring app that enables youth and students to connect with online
mentors for assistance with various issues, such as mental stress or academic support.

 ~Done~ 1. There should be a sign-up and sign-in feature for both mentors and mentees.                  

2. The mentors can provide available slots for meetings that will be displayed next to
their profile picture when a mentee searches for a mentor ( for example, available on
Thursday at 9:00 AM and Friday at 10:00 AM).

3. Mentees should be able to search for mentors based on their skills or job category,
company, review scores, and location.

4. The mentees will first book the meeting from the website. The booking will be
confirmed when the mentors accept the meeting request. In the meeting request, the
mentors will enter the purpose of the meeting and select the available dates (as
mentioned in point 2).

5. This project's mode of communication between mentors and mentees is a simple
text-based chat.

6. Mentees will receive reward points after each successful meeting.

7. Mentees can vote for mentors (upvotes) and provide reviews for them (score out of
five and description).

8. The application will send a simple push notification 15 minutes before the meeting in
a browser.
